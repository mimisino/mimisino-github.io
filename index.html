                                And with every passing minute

                                Tellin' the world about the joy you bring (sweetheart)
                                And you gave me reason for living
                                And ooh, you taught me
                                You taught me the meaning of giving

                                To find a love like yours is rare these days
                                'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
                                I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see
                                Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
                                What you've given me I could never return (baby)
                                'Cause there's so much, girl, I've yet to learn
                                And I want to show my appreciation
                                'Cause when I found you
                                I found a new inspiration
                                Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
                                Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love

                                    When I found out yesterday
                                    Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
                                    Not much longer would you be mine
                                    Oh I heard it through the grapevine

                                    I know a man ain't supposed to cry
                                    But these tears I can't hold inside
                                    Losin' you would end my life you see
                                    'Cause you mean that much to me
                                    You could have told me yourself

                                    Instead I heard it through the grapevine

                                    People say believe half of what you see
                                    Son and none of what you hear
                                    But I can't help but be confused
                                    If it's true please tell me dear
                                    Do you plan to let me go
                                    For the other guy you loved before?
                                    Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine
                                    Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

                                    Ah things ain't what they used to be, no no
                                    Radiation under ground and in the sky
                                    Animals and birds who live nearby are dying
                                    Oh mercy, mercy me
                                    Oh things ain't what they used to be
                                    What about this overcrowded land
                                    How much more abuse from man can she stand?
                                    Oh, no no, na, na na, na
                                    My sweet Lord, na, na, na
                                    My Lord, my sweet Lord<br></p>
